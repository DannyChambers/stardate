# Stardate

An interactive art that is tied to a time and location. Generative, but never random.

#Ideas

1. A single instantiation can last for years, so should only rely on Javascript for single operations that do not monitor interactions constantly or produce long running animations. Instead use CSS.
2. The system should allow for dayes across an entire Eon (10,000 years)
3. I will only mint a date / time / location combnination once.
4.
